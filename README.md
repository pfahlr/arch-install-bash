# Arch Linux Installation Scripts

Here is a set of scripts to simplify the installation of arch linux 

I wrote them because I was having trouble with booting the encrypted drive
and got tired of typing in the earlier steps. I also figured it would help
me retain the information better, but mostly because I am lazy. And like
many of the solutions I attempt to make things easier, it really just 
made it more difficult.

And it's not really arch anymore since I automated the installation
defeating the purpose of arch. So it's more my half-assed arch-based 
distro. 

I might add some custom scripts to install various sets of packages. 

Hope this is useful to someone.

It's amazing I ever made any money in IT. 

Especially while all my peers were struggling.

Fuck Capitalism,
