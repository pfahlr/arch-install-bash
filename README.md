# This repository was created during an attempt to install blackarch. 

I imagine at this point it's only use is as documentation providing a bit of insight into the process of installing Arch Linux. 

That's essentially what I created it for, as a journal of my attempts to install blackarch. 

In the end I did what many posts recommend against and guarantee will result in an unrecoverable system after several rounds of updates. I simply [added the blackarch repository to Manjaro as described in this article](https://infosecjunky.com/installing-blackarch-tools-in-manjaro/). My system never became unusable as a result, but it should be acknowledged that this is not the correct way to do things as this repository represents the entire blackarch distribution and there could be cases where dependencies get all messed up as a result.

I've since read that it is preferable to [add the archstrike repository to manjaro or arch](https://archstrike.org/wiki/setup) if you want access to this selection of pentesting tools 

...

## Since I've abandoned that project, I'll be using this space to keep a collection of notes and resources on the broad topic of Info/Cyber Security. 

Hopefully someone will find it useful, at the very least I'm hoping its existence it might encourage me to keep better notes when experimenting with things. 

If you're new to security and pentesting and ended up here through your searches maybe stumbling around aimlessly seeking some sort of direction but not finding any... allow me to recommend that which was recommended to me. [This may become your new favorite video game.](https://picoctf.org) And if not, I don't know what to tell you. If learning computer science isn't fun for you, I imagine you would need to be a special sort of masochist to be any kind of computer scientist.

### Cybersecurity Conference Archives
  
- Maybe you'll discover something that will fundamentally change the way you think about computer science if you dig around on this site awhile. [watch or listen to on infocon.org](https://infocon.org), and site that provides audio and video archives of cybersecurity conference presentations.

Now I've given this reason to exist, and I'm no longer compelled to delete it.
